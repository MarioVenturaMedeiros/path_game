Hi. this is a silly game about T1 dodging GenG to collect trophies (stars). Hope you enjoy!

# How to run

Get the code in src/rasp (main.py) and upload it in a raspberry pi micro. You will also need 2 push buttons. If you want to change the GPIO, just change the number in the part `PIN_A = 21`. 

Then install pygame (venv recomended) and run the main.py in src/. I know there is 2 main.py, mb. The one in folder rasp is the raspberry code, and in src is the pygame code.

Just run python main.py in src/ and you are good to go. A goes right, B goes left, and good luck collecting the trophies!
